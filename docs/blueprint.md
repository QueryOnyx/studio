# **App Name**: Triad Trials

## Core Features:

- User Authentication and Matchmaking: Authentication system with user profiles and match-making. The user profiles will include a username and the match-making will involve a lobby system. MongoDB will save the authentication system.
- AI Judge & Accuracy Evaluation: Gemini AI acts as the judge, providing the subject for the round and evaluating the accuracy of the final answer using a tool to determine a score between 1-100. Judge can also be human, selected by the game creator.
- Turn-based Gameplay UI: UI to support turn-based gameplay. A Judge selects a prompt (or AI selects it), and then the other two players engage. MongoDB will synchronize the chat.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blues and greys for a professional, focused feel.
- Secondary color: Light grays and whites for readability and contrast.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clear separation of game sections (lobby, game board, profile) using distinct panels or tabs.
- Use simple, professional icons for navigation and in-game actions.
- Subtle transitions between turns and score updates.
